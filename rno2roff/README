rno2eoff

This is a filter to convert DSR RNO (Digital Standard Runoff)
files into Unix nroff files.

There are many differences between RNO and roff, so the final
results may vary wildly, but it should be good enough to get a
reasonable result.

It does not completely cover all the runoff commands, and some
of it just doesn't work right, but it is sufficient for what I
was playing with at the time. You can also produce PostScript
output for a fancier document. Those commands that are not
handles are left in the .roff outout as comments.

Note: This filter is in early development.
It probably isn't very useful at the moment.
It is probably only useful under Unix/Linux due to
it's filter design.

Usage:

	rno2roff < source > dest.roff
	groff -mm dest.roff > dest.ps
	nroff -mm dest.rod > dest.txt

Currently, no options exist.

Compile:
	 c++ -g -o rno2roff rno2roff.cc 

Requirements:
	Under Debian, you need to install the groff package.
	There is a partial install to handle man pages, but ir is
	missing the 'ma' macros.
