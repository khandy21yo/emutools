rno2eoff

This is a filter to convert RSTS/E DSR RNO (Digital Standard
Runoff) files into Unix nroff/troff files. Some VAX RNO commands
are also covered.

There are many differences between RNO and roff, so the final
results may vary wildly, but it should be good enough to get a
reasonable result.

It does not completely cover all the runoff commands, and some
of it just doesn't work right, but it is sufficient for what I
was playing with at the time. You can also produce PostScript
output for a fancier document. Those commands that are not
handles are left in the .roff outout as comments.

Commands require some whitespace between the commands and its
parameters. ".s1" won't work, but ".s 1" will.

RSTS RNO defaults to ".UPPER CASE", but VAX RNO wants the default
to be ".LOWER CASE". Add a ".LOWER CASE", or ".LS" at the top of
the document if you need to forve this.

Note: This filter is in early development.
It probably isn't very useful at the moment.
It is probably only useful under Unix/Linux due to
it's filter design.

Usage:

	rno2roff < source > dest.roff
	groff -mm dest.roff > dest.ps
	nroff -mm dest.rod > dest.txt

Currently, no options exist.

Compile:
	 c++ -g -o rno2roff rno2roff.cc 

Requirements:
	Under Debian, you need to install the groff package.
	There is usually a partial install to handle man pages,
	but ir is missing the 'ma' macros.
