rno2eoff

This is a filter to convert DSR RNO (Digital Standard Runoff)
files into Unix nroff files.


Note: This filter is in early development.
It probably isn't very useful at the moment.
It is probably only useful under Unix/Linux due to
it's filter design.

Usage:

	rno2roff < source > dest.roff
	troff -ms dest.roff > dest.ps
	nrodd -ms dest.rod > dest.txt

Currently, no options exist.

Compile:
	 c++ -g -o rno2roff rno2roff.cc 

Requirements:
	Under Debian, you need to install the groff package.
	There is a partial install to handle man pages, but ir is
	missing the 'ma' macros.
