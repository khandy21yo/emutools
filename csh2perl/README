tcsh2perl

This is a script to help convert tcsh scripts to perl.
Is is designed to convert a specific set of scripts.
A generic tcsh to perl converter is probably impossible.

There are numerus places that it does not do a very good
job. This tool is meant as an aid to conversion, nt a
completely correct translation. It gets confused easily.

You are expected to finish the conversion by hand for all
the things it handles wrong, but it is often easier than
starting from scratch.
