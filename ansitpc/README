ansitpc is a program that will create a tpc tape image file
when given a set of filenames on the command line.

The default output file name is "ansi.tpc", but it can be
chaged using the "-o <filename>" option.

To compile on Linux, use the following

	cc -o ansitpc -lpopt ansitpc.c

This is very much a work in progress, and I haven't tested it
extensively, so it is likely to extremely buggy.


Make sure all of the file names written to the tpc file are
in 6.3 form (six characters, a dot, and three characters).
Also, use unix2dos on those files as necessary for the target
operating system.

VMS currently will only read the first file on the tape.
It also gets snitty if the file name does not contain a period.

RSTS/E reads all the files on the tape.
