ansitpc is a program that will create a tpc tape image file
when given a set of filenames on the command line.

The default output file name is "ansi.tpc", but it can be
chaged using the "-o <filename>" option.

To compile on Linux, use the following

	cc -o ansitpc -lpopt ansitpc.c

This is very much a work in progress, and I haven't tested it
extensively, so it is likely to extremely buggy.


Make sure all of the file names written to the tpc file are
in 6.3 form (six characters, a dot, and three characters).
Also, use unix2dos on those files as necessary for the target
operating system.
