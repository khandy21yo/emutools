This directory contains a python script to convert a Kaypro II font rom into
a modern font file usable by modern systems.

The generated font uses rectangular blocks to generate the font, but it looks
close to what the Kaypro looked like.

Does NOT include any characters that were not available on the Kaypro II.
File/font name currently hardcoded in the script.

There is probably a lot of font options that should be set in the font file,
but that is for another day.

To run, and generate the fontforde file,

	./cvtrom.py

To generate useable font

	fontforge kpii81.sfd

and select file/Generate fonts. It does cause several "Self intersecting" waarnings,
but I'm not sure how to fix this yet. These are caused by the corners of the blocls
that make up the characters touching. Ignore the warning and build anyway.
