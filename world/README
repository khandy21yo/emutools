Someprograms toplay withe the CIA World Databank II data set, available
from https://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/data/WDB/ as a tar file.

These are uick-and-dirty programs just to play with the data. They need to
be run from the same directory as the data set.

The data set is probably dated by now, the polotical boundries are probably
off, but intresting pictures can be generated.

world.perl
	Create world.png using the WDB data set.

world_zipcode.perl
	Overlap lat/long from zipcode table onto the WDB map.
