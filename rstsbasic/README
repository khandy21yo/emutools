This directory contains assorted basic programs for RSTS/E that I
wrote long ago.


decom
	This is the start of a decompiler. It ra\eads in a .BAC
	file and creates a .BAS file. However it is incomplete.
	It should still handle many simple programs.

	decdat.bas creates a table used by the actual decompler.
		This helps reduce the memory usage needed by the
		progeam, since RSTS/E had limited space to start
		with.
	decom.bas the decompler itself. Needs work.

ktoth
	An othello game.

prime
	A prime number generator.

simtap
	Read maktape into a simh tape file inside RSTS/E.

kmaze
	A maze creating program. Similiar to 'amazin' from "101
	Basic Computer Games". This is actually the VS version.
