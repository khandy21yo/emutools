This code was originally taken from the unix-archive from the directory

	unix-archive/PDP-11/Trees/2.11BSD/usr/src/new/l11/

and modified to be able to compile on a modern Linux system.
This involved adding '#include' directives, remiving old prototypes
for system functions 'extern int printf();', and adding prototypes
for functions used-before-defined.

Other changes were madee to handle linking a RT11 object file
from a RSTS/E system. It does something now, but I don't know
exactly how functional it really is.

The code is still mostly in K&R format, except for the bits I
modified.

It expects RT11 format object files.

Some things seem to work (like -v), and some segfault (like -ls)

Command line options defined in link.c are:

	-na:<name>
		Out file name (.out)
	-ls, -mp
		Do_map
	-lp
		Do_map, spool output
	-od
		Do_odt
	-r
		Do_bits
	-c
		Do_bits, C_rel
	-K
		Do_bits, C_rel, Do_kludge
	-
		Do_silent
	-ns
		Do_table
	-go
		No_locals
	-no
		No_out
	-n
		Do_410
	-i
		Do_411
	-v
		Verbose
