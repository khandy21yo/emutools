This code was originally taken from the unix-archive from the directort

	unix-archive/PDP-11/Trees/2.11BSD/usr/src/new/l11/

and modified to be able to compile on a modern Linux system.
This involved adding '#include' directives, remiving old prototypes
for system functions 'extern int printf();', and adding prototypes
for functions used-before-defined.

The code is still mostly in K&R format, except for the prototypes
that I added, and some code to fix compilation problems. I did not
remove the 'register' or 'auto' declarations.
