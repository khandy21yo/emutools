This subdirectory contails my experiments with using the llvm compiler
routines. Hopefully I have documented it sufficiently in the makefile
and the assorted source files to make things understandable.

The makefile assumes that is is running on a Linux (Unix) host.
Thee were designed for an AMD X86_64 (amd) processor. Some changes will
be necessary for other systems (namely the target triple).

truec.c
	Very simmple program. Simply returns EXIT_SUCESS to the host.
	Used to examine llvm generated code.
	Changinng the optimization -O level is interesting.

truel.ll
	Basically the sameprogram, except written directly as llvm code.
