        version 0.4:
        - Fixed various bugs. The most notable was extensive use-
          after-free in the expression tree, which crashed on NetBSD but
          apparently not on other  systems.
        - Lots of changes to make this MACRO11 more like the MACRO11 of
          RSX-11M+ 4.6. I used Kermit-11 source files for comparison.
          "The Manual" I'm refering to is
          AA-KX10A-TC_PDP-11_MACRO-11_Reference_Manual_May88.pdf at
          www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/rsx11/RSX11Mplus_V4.x/4a/ and
          I use an installed system to double-check.

        version 0.3
        - bugfix: Illegal labels and illegal opcodes are processed as
          "implied .WORD" directives.
          Expression errors in "do_word()" did not process any input character,
          so parser did go into an endless loop.
        - Switchable syntax extensions with -yxx options:
          symbol len can be adjusted with "-ysl" command line option.
          "-yus" option allows underscore "_" char in symbols.
          This was needed to process code generated by my favorite disassembler.
        - command line help added (-h option)

17.4.2009: JH
        version 0.3
        - ".INCLUDE" re-enabled
        - refactoring: big 6000+ lines "macro11.c" split into 10 modules.
