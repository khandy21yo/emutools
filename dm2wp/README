The program has been modified by David Gesswein to more accuratly convert
the documents.  It also can generate either wordperfect format, or a 
modified wordperfect format which word likes.  The word conversion seems
to work a little better right now.  Some known issues:

Rulers don't quite work right, not all code are supported, the default
ruler is different (WPS may not have a true default, I think you can
set options on the print menu).  Also how rulers apply between headers
and the body isn't correct.

Right tabs at the end of line confuse word/wordperfect, they overlay
two lines of text in some cases.  WPS wraps the text to the next line.

These seem not too hard to clean up manually.  If you ask nice and provide
an example where it is too hard to fix by hand I might try to change the
program again.

To compile under Linux cc -o dmproces dmproces.c -lm

DOS compiles will need the sizes of some arrays reduced to fit in the
segmented memory model.   This will prevent some documents from converting
properly.

At the top of dmproces.c are the following defines, if you want to convert
to wordperfect change #define WORD to #undef WORD.  To try to compile
under dos change the #define UNIX to #undef (I haven't tried that in a while,
it probably won't work without some changes).  To print debugging information
on the convertion define DEBUG and to dump the file in raw ascii text define
DUMP.

#define UNIX
#define WORD
#undef DEBUG
#undef  DUMP

This version supports RX01 images in the same format used by PDP-8 emulators,
and the version my RX01 dump program on http://highgate.comm.sfu.ca/pdp8/
produces.  

For RX50 disks I used PUTR under DOS with the following options to generate 
the images.  PUTR is available from ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/putr/.

(C:\PUTR)>mount z: gb13.dsk /foreign
(C:\PUTR)>copy/device b: z:
(C:\PUTR)>quit

to run 
dmproces gb13.dsk > results

Results gives some information on the conversion process, look at with your
favorate editor. Sorry, it probably isn't too obvious what some of the
messages it prints really mean.  Many are prints of where it wasn't
obvious what should be done with some of the codes in the file, look
more closely at those files to see how well they converted.

It will create dir.txt which is the directory of the disk, and wp###.wp
which are the documents.

If you need a DOS version email me and I will see if I can get it to compile
again.

DMPROCESS ET AL
===============

This set of programs are designed to convert Decmate II(tm)
DecWord(tm) document disks into WordPerfect(tm) 5.0 format.
The programs are supplies as-is, with no warrenty.

To do a conversion, you will need the following hardware
and software:

        IBM PC or Compatible (XT or greater)
        
        Two floppy drives.
                Drive "A" may be any high density drive,
                either 3.5" or 5.25".
                
                Drive "B" must be a 5.25" floppy, to put
                your Decmate floppies into.

        A bootable floppy containing the following:
                RAINDISK.SYS
                CONFIG.SYS set up properly for RAINDISK
                RAWREAD.EXE

        The program DMPROCES.EXE

        Patience, perseverence, and lots and lots of luck.


Step 1. Creating Disk to Read RX50's
====================================

        Create a bootable floppy disk containing RAINDISK.SYS,
        CONFIG.SYS, and RAWREAD.EXE. You will want to use a
        high density floppy so that you can copy several disk
        images onto it.

        CONFIG.SYS should contain the line

                device=raindos/d:1/f:0

        You could set this up on your hard disk, if you are
        feeling very trusting that the drivers are not going
        to come back and bite you.

        If you have d different configuration than the two
        floppy version I'm describing here, you may need to
        modify RAWREAD.C (so I'm leaving you on your own there).


Step 2: Read an RX50 into a disk image
======================================

        Boot up using the floppy you created in step 1. During
        the boot, RAINDOS should tell you what drive letter it
        is assigning to the Rainbow Drive (C,D,E,...). It will
        not be A or B. Remember this letter.

        Put you Decmate II floppy in the B drive, and run RAWREAD.
        
        It will ask for the name of a disk file to create. For
        example, you may use DOC.DSK.

        Then it will ask for the drive to read, and give it the
        letter you got from RAINDOS.

        It will then (hopefully), read the floppy disk into an
        image file (ie. DOC.DSK), which you will carry to the
        next step.

Step 3: Generating WordPerfect(tm) files from Disk Image
========================================================

        For this step, you will need DMPROCES.EXE.

        Reboot the computer so that you have access to the
        hard disk.
        
        Create a subdirectory for one floppys converted files.
        DMPROCES's naming scheme (if you can call it that) will
        overwrite one run with another's files otherwise.

        Run DMPROCES giving it the name of the Disk image file

                DMPROCES a:DOC.DSK

        It will now generate a number of files in the current
        subdirectory with names such as

                WP0001.WP
                WP0002.WP

        These files are WordPerfect 5.0 format files, and you
        can now scan through them at your leasure. Expect to
        do a lot of editing to get the formatting correct (it
        tries but DecWord and WordPerfect are not very good
        matches).

        I wrote DMPROCES a long time ago, when Decmates still
        walked the Earth. The only changes I have made to the
        program recently is to get it to compile with the current
        version of Borland C without too many errors. The code
        is very old, and some bit rot may have set in. Feel
        free to fix any bugs, and add any enhancements to it,
        but please send me a copy of your changes if they would
        be of any interest to others.
