This is a Unix version of the old ladder game that was
distributed with Kaypro CP/M systems.

I found it on the internet a long time ago, without any
name attached to it.

It has been modified from the original slightly to handle
multiple characters typed, and fix some timing problems.

Requires the curses/ncurses library to compile.
