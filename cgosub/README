This demonstrates how to use BASIC style GOSUB and RETURN
in a C or C++ program.

gosub.cc
This version is based one setjmp/longjmp. Works on most C compilers.
There are some restrictions, which asre the same as those
regarding the use of 'goto', including no jumping outside
of a function, no jumping over variable declarations, etc.
It also seems to confuse debuggers.

gosub2.cc
This is an alternative to the first one. 
It uses GCC extensions, but seems to also work with clang.
I copied this from a web site, and slightly modified it.
This version requires the stack to be global.
I have not yet seen if debuggers like it any better than the
first version yet.
