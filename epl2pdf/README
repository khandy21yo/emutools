epl2pdf

DESCRIPTION

This is a partia program to convert an epl2 file info a pdf file.
It is, as yet, incomplete. It is still in development.
But it is capable of handling some simple spl2 files.

It used popt to handle parsing the command line.
My versions of getopt were just broken when I started this long ago.

It ises the podofo library to handle the PDF utput. This is a poorly
documented package, but it seems to have several nede==cessary
features missing from other libraries.

It uses the zint library to generate the barcodes.
This library containg most, if not all, of the needed barcode
formats necessary to implement the epl2 requirements.

What commands are implemented re only partial at the moment,
missing features as rotation and reverse-image.

Expect bugs, missing sommands, etc.
It is only partiall at the moment.


BUILDING

This used the cmake package to build.
I am using it because it does not seem to break as often as
the autoconf/automake backage does.

It is currently only been tested on Debian Linux.

To Build, cd to the source directory and type

	cmake .
	make

RUNNING

While in the build directory, type

	./epl2pdf myfile.epl2

It generates a file '/tmp/spl2pdf.pdf'.
