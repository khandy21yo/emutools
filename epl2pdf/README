epl2pdf

DESCRIPTION

This is a partia program to convert an epl2 file info a pdf file.
It is, as yet, incomplete. It is still in development.
But it is capable of handling some simple spl2 files.

It uses popt to handle parsing the command line.
My versions of getopt were just broken when I started this long ago.

It uses the podofo library to handle the PDF utput. This is a poorly
documented package, but it seems to have several necessary
features missing from other libraries.

It uses the zint library to generate the barcodes.
This library containg most, if not all, of the needed barcode
formats necessary to implement the epl2 requirements.

What commands are implemented re only partial at the moment,
missing features as rotation and reverse-image.

Expect bugs, missing sommands, etc.
It is only partiall at the moment.

COMPILING

This progeam is compiled using the 'cmake' system.

	cmake .
	make

USAGE

The program is command line driven. It isn't complete yet, so is missing
several features that will be necessary for actual use.

	./epl2pdf source.epl2

This reads in the file 'source.epl2' and creates '/tmp/epl2pdf.pdf'.
The output file name is current;y hardcoded in the program.

WARNING

Do not expect an exact match between the EPL2 output and the PDF
output. There are many differences between them.

EPL2 assumes that things are being created on a bitmap, which is
different than PDFs vector format. Some things, like XORing the data
is not handled easily.

The program used specific fonts (Courier-Prime) for PDF, and not the
actual EPL2 fonts. Character shapes and sizes may be somewhat different.
'Courier-Prime' just happens to be the bold courier font on my machine.

Converting from the EPL2 point dimensions to the PDF points can end up
causing slight position and size issues. Objects can vary size and
position by a pixel or two in the conversion.

If you get the error
	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'PoDoFo::PdfError'
then you probably already have a /tmp/epl2pdf.pdf file under another user.
Remove it and try again.


BUILDING

This used the cmake package to build.
I am using it because it does not seem to break as often as
the autoconf/automake backage does.

It is currently only been tested on Debian Linux.

To Build, cd to the source directory and type

	cmake .
	make

RUNNING

While in the build directory, type

	./epl2pdf myfile.epl2

It generates a file '/tmp/spl2pdf.pdf'.


KNOWN BUGS

Output file is, by default /tmp/epl2pdf.pdf. If you run this under two different
users, the program will fail due to no write access. Remove thsise file before
running program under a new user.

Minimal implmentation of commands. Only a few EPL2 commands are handled.

Incomplete implementations. Many features of the implemented operations are not
handled yet, such as rotation and reverse colors.

epl2 and pdf seem to have very different ideas about positioning items, such as
which point of an object is the corner.
