	HOW IT WORKS
Converting EPL2 Documents to PDF

INTRODUCTION

	This document describes some of the considerations that need to be
	made in the translation from EPL2 to PDDF.  It probably misses may
	of the finer details, as it is just a rough overvire.

DEFINITIONS

	When the text refers to a "Page", that represents whatever form or
	label used in the printer.

SIZES USED

	This is refering to the size of the units used to position items on
	the page.

	The EPL2 printers are based on pixels, of which there are either 203
	per inch, or optionally 300 per inch, depending on the printer used.
	This progran defaults to 203 because that seems to be how most of the
	printers are configured out of the box.

	PDF printers are based on points (which is a standard size
	in typography, based on the size of a period)  of which there are 72
	per inch.

	So measurements must be adjusted to convert from pixels to points.
	This is done by dividing by 203, then multiplying by 72.

ORIGIN

	This revers to where the (0,0) point is located.

	EPL2 printers place the (0,0) point at the top left of the page.
	Moving to (1,1) moves down one pixel and to the right one pixel.

	PDF places the (0,0) at the bottom left of the page. Moving to
	(1,1) requires moving up one poit, and to the right one point.

	The horizontal positioning only needs the pixelto point adjustment,
	but vertical position needs the pixel to point conversion, aas well
	as an adjustment to switch the origin from the top to the bottom.

	The vertical position is calculated as
	"(page height) - (EPL_Y * 72 / 203)"

FONTS

	The fonts are the glyphs that are used to display text.

	EPL2 fonts are fixed width bitmaps. The individual glyphs consist of
	a two dimensional grid specifing which pixels to paint. They include
	one pixel wide band arount=d the ehtore glyph. The reference point
	for placing the glyph is the upper left corner, which is normally
	one of the white border pixels.

	PDF fonts are vecters, and this program prefers fixed width fonts,
	such as a Courier font. They usually contain whitespace around the
	glyphs, but are not pixel pased. The reference point is at the borrom
	left of the base of the uppercase part of the letters. excluding
	the whitespace.

	Converting character positions is complicated.

BARCODES

	Barcodes refer to the machine readable codes generated the the "B" and
	"b" commands.

	EPL2 places the reference point at the to left of the symbol.

	PDF placed the reference point at the bottom left of the symbol.

ROTATION

	The EPL2 command set allows for rotation by 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees.

	While rotating, care must be taken to note the difference in the
	reference point from the upper left to the lower left position.
